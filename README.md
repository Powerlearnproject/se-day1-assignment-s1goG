#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry
software engineering is the systematic development of high quality software products using engineering principles, tools and methodologies.

software engineering is omportant because it provides a means for developing reliable, stable innovative solutions that meet user needs.


2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
1. Development of programming languages.
2. Advent of structured programming.
3. The rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements-Involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design- Involves developing softwarearchitecture and user interface.
3. Implementation - Is the actual writing of code and building software according to specifications.
4. Testing - Ensuring software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment - Is theactual release of the product to the users.
6. Maintainance - Involves the ongoing support, updates and enhancements.

 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer -A software developer writes the actual code and implements software solutions.

Quality Assurance Engineer - Is the person that designs and executes test plans and ensures products meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.

Project Manager - The project manager oversees planning, execution and delivery of software systems.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) contains many intelligent features for automatically writing, editing, debugging and testing the source code.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help track changes to source code and co-ordinating work among a development team.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements
 Solution: Regularly reassessing project goals and timelines.
2. Tight deadlines
 Solution: Having effective communication.
3. Technical debt  
 Solution:Prioritizing important tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit tests -testing individual components used by a software and ensuring that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
2. Integration tests - verifies that different modules used by the application work well together.
3. System testing - ensures that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
4. Acceptance tests - This testing is against user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs.

   
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a picture of a person
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
